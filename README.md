## What is Project HealthCare?
Project Healthcare is an open-source platform designed to connect patients with healthcare providers through location-based services. The system helps users find nearby healthcare professionals for consultations, diagnostics, and medical services. It enables seamless interactions by leveraging APIs and location-based technology.

![xcov19_demo_ezgif-3-0edbb84875](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/438e2e2c-a40f-49fc-84b0-20037acf22d6)

## Vision
The Healthcare Project aims to revolutionize access to healthcare by providing a seamless, location-based platform that connects patients with healthcare providers. 
By leveraging modern technology, the platform enables patients to easily find nearby doctors, book consultations, and access diagnostic services, all while ensuring security, reliability, and ease of use. The goal is to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare professionals, improving the efficiency and quality of care through digital innovation.

# Project Healthcare (xcov19)

Project Healthcare, from hereon called the brokering service, is a set of upstream OpenAPI specification to extend any patient facing user interface looking to integrate to location-aware consultation and diagnostics facilities near them by:

1. Exposing a diagnosis API to capture patient symptoms.
2. Exposing geolocation API to caputure patient's location and offer nearby facilities to take action on based on their diagnosis and location.

## Extensible and Open

Unlock advanced healthcare integration without the enterprise price tag. Connect systems, personalize care, and reach underserved communities with ease.
Built using modified project template for [BlackSheep](https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheep)
web framework to start Web APIs, the project structure adheres blacksheep's domain and infrastructure segregation philosophy. It naturally fits the 
domain driven design philosophy using ports and adapters pattern so expect slight shift towards domain models and services structure.

The specification follows a sandwich service model i.e. it requires one or more upstream producer services and one downstream consumer service as follows:

1. The patient facing application, known from hereon as the downstream consumer service, calls the diagnosis and geolocation API.
2. The brokering service stores transient diagnosis request and enqueues them to upstream provider service that should return records of facilities and their specialties based on the diagnosis.
3. The brokering service returns the records of matching facilities to the downstream consumer service.

### What Sets Us Apart?

Unlike other platforms, HIS combines advanced features in one solution, delivering exceptional healthcare services without the complexity or high costs.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
##### Before diving into the Project Healthcare, it's recommended to familiarize yourself with the following technologies and tools:
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)

- [Blacksheep Framework](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/)

- [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Installation Steps
#### For Windows User:
-  Install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)  (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Install Ubuntu (or a preferred distribution)
- After setting up WSL,the remaining steps are the same as for Linux/Mac users.
#### For Linux and Mac User:
##### 1) Once you have WSL running with Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install make` in ubuntu terminal
##### 2) Install Poetry: `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - `
##### 3) Clone the Project by running: `git clone https://github.com/Xcov19/project-healthcare/` `cd project-healthcare`
##### 4) Install the dependencies using poetry: `poetry install --no-root --with=dev` or run the `install.sh` script
##### 5) Run the project using `make run` or `./run.sh` to start the application
## Deploy 
[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Xcov19/project-healthcare)

To test the instance on Render, set the following environment variables:
```bash
PYTHON_VERSION=3.12.4
PORT=44777
```
## Sandbox for reference
A reference instance exists on [Render](https://project-healthcare.onrender.com/docs)

See [Deploy](README.md#deploy) to spin up your own instance.

## Learn the Basics
Project Healthcare is an open-source platform designed to provide location-aware healthcare services. Below is a high-level breakdown:

### Key Components:
 
#### 1) **Diagnosis API** : Captures patient symptoms and fetches relevant healthcare facility data.
#### 2) **Geolocation API** : Captures the patient's location and suggests nearby facilities.
#### 3) **Queue System** : Handles request storage, temporary results, and queuing for the diagnosis process.
#### 4) **Facility Database** : A collection of healthcare facilities and their specialties.
#### 5) **Patient App** : A front-end that communicates with the APIs to fetch data

### Sequence Diagram

## Background

85% of the world's population is in the Emerging Market, of which the majority of single nationality is in India with >700Mn+ smartphone users. Still, as of 2021, we ranked at the very top in the number of neglected tropical diseases cases requiring treatment that included Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya amongst others:
![image info](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b5d3239-953e-48cd-9ba7-ba99d13b5d4f_3400x2943.png)


Despite technological advancements and introduction of PM-JAY:

1. 70% of the Indian healthcare being private, ~70% out of them run on pen and paper and are technically challenged in adapting to the fast changing digital infra landscape thus impeding the ease of operations for OPD and in-patient registration, triage and treatment.
2. 43% of Indian population including financially underprivileged sections of our society lack basic healthcare awareness. There is a huge demographic divide that dictates the quality of medical care and consultation in our country that can be availed. This is despite technological advancements and India positioning itself as a welfare state. (The Out of Pocket expenditure for the middle class has significantly risen but that is not in the scope of this topic.)
3. Additionally, UN Sustainability Goals scores India somewhere in the lower bounds of 60-80 out of 100 in terms of healthcare serviceability index.(UN SDG 3.8.1)

With alot of avenues today in the identity, payments, and data ecosystem pioneered by NPCI and further extended by Bekn protocol, governed by FIDE, in OCEN, ONDC and Open Mobility space, National health authority too has been working on Unified Healthcare Interface for sometime building the Indian Health Stack integrating turn-key healthtech private solutions with ABDM.

Just like many applications being built on top of this layer for the identify, mobility, ecommerce & trade and fintech segments, there are 2 use cases to build an opensource commons platform upon Bharat Health Stack:

- Solve unnecessary resource utilisation: Fix disproportionate allocation of resource constraints faced due to operational inefficiency across healthcare facilities.
- Reduce wait times for dissatisfied patients: Provide reduced wait times for consultation and out-patient services for at-risk patients by fixing inconsistent distribution of patient influx. This happens because patients are not aware of all the possible options (Think zomato of healthcare)

A public and open solution to these use cases makes sense because:

1. Much of the government's ABDM components are built in the open
2. Many proponents of OSS have been building such systems such as Healthstack system in Bangladesh.
3. By building out an opensource version, it makes sense to verify, audit and get feedback faster, build faster and better, aligned to the common's need.
4. And truly be transparent.
